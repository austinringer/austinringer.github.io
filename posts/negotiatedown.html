    <br><br><br>
    <p>11 months ago I talked my way to a smaller pay check, and I’m so glad I did. You heard right, I marked some time to chat with my mentor and boss, founder of the software
      startup I worked for, and opened with something like this. “As you know, I thoroughly enjoy working here. As you also know, I will be graduating from college in a few months.
      As you may or may not know, I want to make less money.”</p>


    <p>This is the sort of request that requires explaining so I elucidated, spilling details around my “<a href="https://www.quora.com/If-I-were-to-devote-300-hours-this-summer-12-weeks-to-learn-to-code-what-are-some-reasonable-goals-strategies">300 hours of code</a>” summer challenge and spreadsheet filled with positions I
      was pursuing at other companies. I had worked with my then boss for more than a year at this point and I am hugely grateful for the career catalyst projects he made sure to
      include me in during that time. What’s more, I really enjoyed my day-to-day work. However, I caught an itch in the form of a new interest — computer programming — and I wanted
      to make this hobby my job. <span style="background-color: #dbecfc">I would ask to be paid while learning to be a software developer</span>. It worked!</p>

    <h2>Same Same But Different</h2>
    <br>
    <p>In any <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/salary-negotiation/">negotiation</a> the idea is to reach an understanding that is mutually amicable. A win-win. Requesting a pay cut is no different. Here are a few things we both stood to
      gain from my moving into a position as a developer.</p>
    <br>

    <p>
      <ul>GOOD FOR ME
        <li><span style="background-color: #dbecfc">Get paid to learn</span></li>
        <li>Zero Cost of Coding Bootcamp or Formal Education</li>
        <li>Pivot career toward product-related positions</li>
      </ul>

        <ul>GOOD FOR COMPANY
        <li>Payroll savings</li>
        <li>Employee retention (me)</li>
        <li>Likely to explore projects deeply from home (free labor)</li>
        <li>Added customer empathy on Dev Team</li>
      </ul>

    </p>

      <h2>Timing is Everything</h2>
      <br>
      <p>In hindsight, I realize that my request came at a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140803091119-52594-the-five-best-times-to-ask-for-a-raise">perfect time</a> for everyone. After months of hard work our company had been acquired and as a result we were no
        longer as strapped for resources. Hiring ticked up and individual responsibilities were spread around for more manageable work loads. With focus expanding
        toward longer term goals it only made sense to start experimenting a little. I was happy to be an experiment.</p>

      <h2>I Pivoted, Now What</h2>
      <p>My pivot was far from graceful and I still have a long way to go honing my new craft. I've moved to San Francisco to work for a company where I will continue
        to get a little better at programming every day. </p>
      <p>I'll leave you with this quote I chomped on for two years before finally beginning to learn web development.</p>

      <p><i>Stop hoping for completion in anything in life […] It’s never going to be over, so stop waiting for the good stuff. As of now, <span style="background-color: #dbecfc">spend a minimum of one
        hour a day doing whatever you are waiting to do</span> until your finances are more secure, or until the children have grown and left home, or until you have finished
        your obligations and you feel free to do what you really want to do. </i>
        <div align="right">
          -David Deida
        </div>
      </p>

        <p>If I can help you in any way as you consider pivoting toward your purpose, I'd love to chat. Huge, huge thanks to those that have helped me make this change. </p>
